Hi!

I have a pistachio farm.

It's composed by:

- a water well equipped with a submersible pump
- a water storage tank equipped with a water pump
- a drip irrigation network installed using only one valve

As an electrical engineer, i think that my motors control panels are very basic. The tank filling and the irrigation operations are hard to monitor and track: I need a smart automated irrigation system.

So, this is my next challenge that i would be happy to share with you including all the steps.

Electronic components and coding are waiting...
